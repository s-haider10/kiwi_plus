I mean, they have it appears that they are coming on super strong. Yeah. I assume they'll be a really serious competitor. Did you expect that? Yes. You did? Yes. And what are they doing? What are they doing? And how have they been able to literally spin up a company that feels I'm not claiming it's comparable to what you're doing, but getting super close super fast.

Like, you know, when people talk about scaling laws, the best analogy for that, I think, is Moore's Law. And that came to be used by a lot of companies and all of the world. Like, look at all the things in this room with transistors. But we don't think about that as a transistor device, and we don't think about Google as a transistor company, even though they wouldn't be here without one.
