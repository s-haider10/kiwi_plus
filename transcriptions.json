I'm a lecturer in the EECS department, and I'll be giving some of the lectures for today, along with later on in the term. Professor Eric Grimson, who's sitting right down there, will be giving some of the lectures as well. Okay. So today we're going to go over some just basic administrivia, a little bit of course information, and then we're going to talk a little bit about what is computation.

And then during lectures, if the lecturer was talking about something that suddenly I remembered, oh, I saw that word in the pset, and I didn't know what it was. Well, hey, now I know what it is, right? So just give it a read. You don't need to start it if you're new to programming. I think the keyword is practice. So it's like math or reading.

With data structures. That's sort of the broad term for that. And then as you're writing programs, you need to. Programs aren't just linear. Sometimes programs jump around, they make decisions.

It's going to pop that into the memory and it's going to assign, because we're using the equal sign, it's going to assign that value to that variable area. So now let's say we rebind.
